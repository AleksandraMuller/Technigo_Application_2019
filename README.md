# Technigo_Application_2019

This is my solution for the code introduction. Since my birthday is the 18th of June I explained Node.js from the glossary.

The solution works for the screen width of around 1350px as I did not use any Media Queries.

I use clip-path and this means that the solution is not working in some browsers. Please check for compatibility here:
